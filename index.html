      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
        The foundation of my interest and career in healthcare technology began at Epic. There, I developed expertise in leading large-scale technology projects and specialized in the healthcare revenue cycle. I enrolled in business school to further develop my dual focus on technology and healthcare by sharpening my knowledge of technology strategy and marketing, developing an analytical toolkit for data driven management decisions, and pursuing further understanding of programming and information technology.
